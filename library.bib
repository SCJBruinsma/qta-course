The fitted model can be used to estimate the similarity between documents as well as between a set of specified keywords using an additional layer of latent variables which are referred to as topics. The R package topicmodels provides basic infrastructure for fitting topic models based on data structures from the text mining package tm. The package includes interfaces to two algorithms for fitting topic models: the variational expectation-maximization algorithm provided by David M. Blei and co-authors and an algorithm using Gibbs sampling by Xuan-Hieu Phan and co-authors.},

  abstract  = {According to modernisation theory, electoral participation should become less important in modern democracies. Modern citizens feel more capable of handling their own political affairs, thus they will decide for themselves when and how to get involved in political action, and consequentially will not automatically cast their vote. This view has in recent years often been rephrased into the expectation that electoral turnout in Western societies will decrease. However, this expectation is at odds with current knowledge about the development of the most important individual characteristic associated with electoral participation --- i.e. the level of education --- thus giving rise to a puzzle of turnout. This chapter addresses the turnout puzzle and provides an alternative explanation of varying turnout figures: the political context of the election. The political context (polarisation, degree of alienation and of indifference) is shown to account for trends and fluctuations in turnout in the six European democracies for up to 40 years.},

  abstract  = {A Voting Advice Application (VAA) is a web application that recommends to a voter the party or the candidate, who replied like him/her in an online questionnaire. Every question is responding to the political positions of each party. If the voter fails to answer some questions, it is likely the VAA to offer him/her the wrong candidate. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect the missing data (not answered questions) and try to estimate them. In this paper we formulate the VAA missing value problem and investigate several different approaches of collaborative filtering to tackle it. The evaluation of the proposed approaches was done by using the data obtained from the Cypriot presidential elections of February 2013 and the parliamentary elections in Greece in May, 2012. The corresponding datasets are made freely available to other researchers working in the areas of VAA and recommender systems through the Web.},

More broadly, how does dimensionality vary across countries? We attempt to advance our understanding of political contestation in Europe by mapping the dimensionality of the political space across 24 countries using Chapel Hill expert survey (CHES) data. We test how well different models of the European political space fit the CHES data and find that three-dimensional models best fit the data in all countries. However, there is considerable cross-national variation in how the three dimensions relate to one another. Given this, we present a new measure of dimensional complexity that captures the degree to which these three dimensions are related. In so doing, we improve our understanding of the complexity of the political space in European countries.},

A 2 $\times$ 3 design in which item stem direction and item response pattern direction were crossed was used to determine effects on internal consistency reliability as measured by Cronbachs alpha. The condition having the highest alpha was when all directly worded stems were used with bidirectional response options. Alpha was higher and accounted for at least 10\%, and in one case 20\%, higher internal consistency as compared with any of the three conditions in which negatively worded stems were used. This would indicate that the use of all directly worded stems and half of the response options going in one direction and half going in the other direction may be a better way of guarding against acquiescence and response set behaviors than the use of items with negatively worded stems.},

  abstract  = {Recent scholarship has emphasized the potential importance of cues, information shortcuts, and statistical aggregation processes in allowing relatively uninformed citizens to act, individually or collectively, as if they were fully informed. Uninformed voters successfully use cues and information shortcuts to behave as if they were fully informed. Failing that, individual deviations from fully informed voting cancel out in a mass electorate, producing the same aggregate election outcome as if voters were fully informed. Hypothetical "fully informed" vote choices are imputed to individual voters using the observed relationship between political information and vote choices for voters with similar social and demographic characteristics, estimated by probit analysis of data from National Election Study surveys conducted after the six most recent United States presidential elections. Both hypotheses are clearly disconfirmed. At the individual level, the average deviation of actual vote probabilities from hypothetical "fully informed" vote probabilities was about ten percentage points. In the electorate as a whole, these deviations were significantly diluted by aggregation, but by no means eliminated: incumbent presidents did almost five percentage points better, and Democratic candidates did almost two percentage points better, than they would have if voters had in fact been "fully informed."},

  abstract  = {I argue that institutional context conditions the effect of socioeconomic resources on individuals' levels of political sophistication. Specifically, because the decision to become sophisticated is quite expensive for citizens at the lower end of the SES scale, the relatively high levels of free information produced in certain party and electoral system contexts leads disproportionately large numbers of these citizens---as compared to those with more resources---to decide to become politically sophisticated. I formulate and test (using OLS regression) a conditional model of political sophistication that includes institutional context variables, a "resources" factor score, and interaction terms representing the product of "resources" and each of these context variables. The model is supported empirically. The interaction term coefficients have signs that are the reverse of those for the context variables, indicating that the effect of resources on sophistication is greater or smaller depending on the value of the institutional variables. This conditional effect is graphically depicted.},

  abstract  = {This chapter tests the validity of two alternative theoretical perspectives on the evolution of party identification. According to the first perspective, which is based on the theory of modernization, one should expect a secular decline of the level of party identification. The reason is that modern, well educated citizens do not need the cue of party identification anymore. The second perspective focuses on political rather than social correlates of party identification, and predicts less linear developments. Adversary politics is supposed to be favourable for the development of partisanship, while a broad political consensus across the major parties is expected to suppress the development of party identification. Whereas the first perspective predicts a linear decline of partisanship, the second one does not. The empirical evidence with regard to the first perspective is mixed. Although party identifiers have become less numerous over time, this development is anything but monotonous in most countries. Moreover, the micro-theory underlying the theory of modernisation is not corroborated. Contrary to expectations, cognitive mobilisation does not lead to a lower level of party identification. However, the evidence supporting the second perspective is equally ambivalent. The political correlates of the development of party identification are modest at best, and cannot fully explain what is going on in the six West European countries under study.},

We depart from this sometimes accurate, at other times overly strong assumption by studying patterns of intra-party heterogeneity of preferences within parliamentary parties in the German Bundestag from 2002--05. For this purpose, we use the Wordscores method, a form of computational text analysis, to estimate policy positions of 453 individual legislators based on plenary speeches. We then study the link between intra-party faction membership and expressed policy positions. We find that there is a limited, but consistent effect of intra-party factionalism in the German Bundestag. According to random effects ANOVA, faction membership determines about 3 per cent of the variance of positions on economic policy in the present study.},

  abstract  = {Political participation researchers have developed several evaluative techniques to assess the representativeness of political participation patterns. Yet, while the Internet has become a mainstream avenue for political participation in the United States, current assessments of online participation insufficiently apply these methods. To incorporate these methods we begin by drawing upon resource theory to inform two-stage ordered-logit models of online and offline political participation. Our results suggest that the factors predicting online participation often differ from the factors that predict offline participation. Even so, we find that those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds tend to disproportionately possess these distinct online determinants. Next, we use a wide spectrum of political opinion questions to determine whether online participators' opinions reflect or distort those of the general population. Overall, we find that online participation tends to relate moderately with liberal preferences. However, because offline participation relates to political attitudes similarly, the Internet only marginally advantages the political voice of liberals. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results.},

  abstract = {In the information age, a persons ability to read and make data visualizations is nearly as important as being able to read and write text. This article reports the results of a multi-phase study conducted in informal learning environments in three US science museums. The goal of the study was to determine the familiarity of youth and adult museum visitors with different visualization types. To address this, a total of 273 visitors were shown 5 out of 20 different visualizations that included two charts, five maps, eight graphs, and five network layouts. They were asked to judge the familiarity of the visualization, provide information on how to read it, and provide a name and identify typical locations where they would encounter the data display and possible data sources that might be visualized in this way. The results show that while most participants have a strong interest in science, math, and art, many have a hard time naming and interpreting visualizations. Participants in this study commonly encounter visualizations in school, in books, at work, on the Internet, and in the news. Overall, they were more familiar with basic charts, maps, and graphs, but very few are familiar with network layouts and most have no ability in reading network visualizations. When asked how they would interpret the visualizations, most participants pointed to superficial features such as color, lines, or text as important to developing understanding. Overall, we found that participants were interested in the visualizations we presented to them, but had significant limitations in identifying and understanding them. The results substantiate intuitions shared by many regarding the rather low level of data visualization literacy of general audiences. We hope they will help catalyze novel research on the development of easy-to-use yet effective visualizations with standardized names and guaranteed properties that can be readily used by those interested to understand and solve real-world problems. The results also have implications for how information visualizations are taught and used in formal and informal education, the media, or in different professions.},

Participants included 192 male and 132 female undergraduates. Estimates that could be evaluated for accuracy for each of the problems were collected for a series of three trials. One set of groups received face-to-face verbal feedback from each other, while the other set received written feedback. These data were compared to mean estimates obtained from randomly selected, pooled individual estimates. The results suggested that the pooled individual estimates were somewhat more accurate than those obtained from either of the interacting groups. At the same time, all individuals became more confident of their answers, suggesting the possibility of groupthink. No effects for different group sizes were found, possibly due to the constraints imposed by the structured nature of the two techniques.},

Critics have argued that deliberative democracy does the latter rather than the former. But they have not sufficiently shown how this works, why exactly it is problematic, and how the associated problems may be overcome. Drawing on recent literature on Ludwig Wittgenstein's idea of being held captive by a picture, I develop a conceptual framework for understanding these questions. Drawing on recent empirical work on the realities of deliberative democracy, I show why empirical accounts of democracy demand that we learn to see democracy under many different aspects of which deliberation is an important, but not necessarily the essential one.},

  abstract = {Effect sizes obtained from 39 experiments were used to evaluate the predictions of the basic tasks model of graphical efficacy. This model predicts that performance will be attenuated with graphical displays as a function of the particular specifier, or visual dimension, used to code data values. In this review the basic tasks model predicted performance more accurately than did Tufte's data-ink principle. In addition, variability in effect sizes across studies revealed that the model was more successful at predicting performance in local (focusing) tasks than in global information synthesis tasks. Furthermore, the model was better at predicting performance in tasks requiring the use of physically present rather than remembered graphs. Further differences in effect sizes resulted from variability in the exact specifiers used in experimental graphs. Minimal differences were obtained among graphs that used position, length, or angle as specifiers. However, graphs that used area or volume to represent quantitative values were associated with consistently worse performance than found with other formats.},

  abstract = {An additive multilevel item structure (AMIS) model with random residuals is proposed. The model includes multilevel latent regressions of item discrimination and item difficulty parameters on covariates at both item and item category levels with random residuals at both levels. The AMIS model is useful for explanation purposes and also for prediction purposes as in an item generation context. The parameters can be estimated with an alternating imputation posterior algorithm that makes use of adaptive quadrature, and the performance of this algorithm is evaluated in a simulation study.},

  abstract  = {The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

The additions we discuss here-some new and some old-are (a) sunflowers, (b) category codes, (c) point cloud sizings, (d) smoothings for the dependence of y on x (middle smoothings, spread smoothings, and upper and lower smoothings), and (e) smoothings for the bivariate distribution of x and y (pairs of middle smoothings, sum-difference smoothings, scale-ratio smoothings, and polar smoothings). The development of these additions is based in part on a number of graphical principles that can be applied to the development of statistical graphics in general.},

  abstractnote = {We develop a Bayesian procedure for estimation and inference for spatial models of roll call voting. This approach is extremely flexible, applicable to any legislative setting, irrespective of size, the extremism of the legislators voting histories, or the number of roll calls available for analysis. The model is easily extended to let other sources of information inform the analysis of roll call data, such as the number and nature of the underlying dimensions, the presence of party whipping, the determinants of legislator preferences, and the evolution of the legislative agenda; this is especially helpful since generally it is inappropriate to use estimates of extant methods (usually generated under assumptions of sincere voting) to test models embodying alternate assumptions (e.g., log-rolling, party discipline). A Bayesian approach also provides a coherent framework for estimation and inference with roll call data that eludes extant methods; moreover, via Bayesian simulation methods, it is straightforward to generate uncertainty assessments or hypothesis tests concerning any auxiliary quantity of interest or to formally compare models. In a series of examples we show how our method is easily extended to accommodate theoretically interesting models of legislative behavior. Our goal is to provide a statistical framework for combining the measurement of legislative preferences with tests of models of legislative behavior.},

  abstract  = {Elections are widely believed to have become beauty contests in which voters decide who to vote for on the basis of which party leader they like most, rather than which party they think has the best policies or will best represent their interests. Scant evidence was found in support of this proposition. Voters evaluations of party leaders appear to be as important or unimportant now as they were when they were first measured. Part of the reason for this appears to be the fact that the importance of leaders is constrained by the political structure in which elections take place. There is strong evidence that leaders matter when a parliamentary election comes closest to mimicking a presidential contest. That is, when the next head of government is likely to be the leader of whichever of two large parties can win the most votes without the need to engage in significant post-election coalition bargaining.},

This article focuses on the differential possession of internet skills among the Dutch population. In two studies, an in-depth range of internet skills are measured by charging subjects assignments to be accomplished on the internet. Subjects were recruited by applying a random stratified sampling method over gender, age, and education. While the level of operational and formal internet skills appeared quite high, the level of information and strategic internet skills is questionable. Whereas education appeared an important contributor to all skill levels, age only appeared a significant contributor to operational and formal skills. The results strengthen the findings that the original digital divide of physical internet access has evolved into a divide that includes differences in skills to use the internet.},

Less important elections are predicted to have lower turnout, but a feedback mechanism keeps turnout at a reasonable level under a wide range of conditions. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) to show how, for an individual with both selfish and social preferences, the social preferences will dominate and make it rational for a typical person to vote even in large elections;(2) to show that rational socially-motivated voting has a feedback mechanism that stabilizes turnout at reasonable levels (e.g., 50\% of the electorate); (3) to link the rational social-utility model of voter turnout with survey findings on socially-motivated vote choice.},

  abstract  = {This paper undertakes a systematic assessment of the extent to which factor analysis the correct number of latent dimensions (factors) when applied to ordered-categorical survey items (so-called Likert items). We simulate 2400 data sets of uni-dimensional Likert items that vary systematically over a range of conditions such as the underlying population distribution, the number of items, the level of random error, and characteristics of items and item-sets. Each of these datasets is factor analysed in a variety of ways that are frequently used in the extant literature, or that are recommended in current methodological texts. These include exploratory factor retention heuristics such as Kaisers criterion, Parallel Analysis and a non-graphical scree test, and (for exploratory and confirmatory analyses) evaluations of model fit. These analyses are conducted on the basis of Pearson and polychoric correlations. We find that, irrespective of the particular mode of analysis, factor analysis applied to ordered-categorical survey data very often leads to over-dimensionalisation. The magnitude of this risk depends on the specific way in which factor analysis is conducted, the number of items, the properties of the set of items, and the underlying population distribution. The paper concludes with a discussion of the consequences of over-dimensionalisation, and a brief mention of alternative modes of analysis that are much less prone to such problems.},

Our sample consists of 765 weekly observations on those positions as well as on the corresponding political party preference. The time series data display nonstationary patterns in the sense that their means are not constant over time. Therefore, we rely on recently developed techniques in the analysis of multivariate nonstationary time series to study convergence. One of our results is that the ideological positions, when considered relative to a benchmark, can be described by trend-stationary processes. This means that we cannot reject the presence of convergence. Implications of this result are discussed.},

  abstractnote = {Explanatory typologies are powerful tools in the qualitative study of international politics. They are likely to be most valuable when scholars systematically apply shared techniques. This article provides an account of analytic steps used in working with typologies, and an accessible vocabulary to describe them. These analytic steps are illustrated with concrete examples drawn from prominent versions of offensive structural, defensive structural, and neoclassical realism. Five forms of cell compression---rescaling and indexing, as well as logical, empirical, and pragmatic compression---are considered, along with the drawbacks associated with each. The expansion of a partial typology and the rediscovery of deleted cells are also discussed. Finally, the article considers the potential drawbacks of a typological approach, and argues that scholars must be mindful of the risks of reification and of relabeling anomalies.I am especially grateful to David Collier for extensive critiques of several drafts of this article. Stephen G. Walker, Miriam Fendius Elman, James Mahoney, Gary Goertz, Reilly ONeal, John Gerring, Bear Braumoeller, Lisa Martin, two anonymous reviewers, and the participants at the January 2004 Institute for Qualitative Research Methods at Arizona State University provided valuable comments.

Patterns have had significant impact in a wide array of disciplines, particularly software engineering, and we believe that they provide a powerful lens for characterizing visualization evaluation practices by offering practical, tried-and-tested tips, and tricks that can be adopted immediately. The 20 patterns presented here have also been added to a freely editable Wiki repository. The motivation for creating this evaluation pattern language is to (a) capture and formalize dark practices for visualization evaluation not currently recorded in the literature, (b) disseminate these hard-won experiences to researchers and practitioners alike, (c) provide a standardized vocabulary for designing visualization evaluation, and (d) invite the community to add new evaluation patterns to a growing repository of patterns.},

  abstract  = {Butler and Stokes' authoritative analysis of the British electorate concluded that in general voters' political attitudes were poorly formed and, in consequence, unstable and inconsistent. This paper re-examines this question by developing and evaluating multiple-item scales of two core dimensions of mass political beliefs: left-right and libertarian-authoritarian values. The scales are shown to have respectable levels of internal consistency, high levels of stability over a one-year period, and to be useful predictors of support for political parties. In these respects they compare favourably with other commonly used indicators of political attitudes, values and ideology (left-right self-placement, postmaterialism and attitudes to nationalization). This superiority applies across different levels of political involvement. Contrary to the conclusions of earlier research into mass political ideology in Britain, therefore, it is contended that in general the electorate has meaningful political beliefs. Moreover, as the scales developed in this research form part of the British and Northern Irish Social Attitudes Series and recent British Election Studies, they provide an important resource for further studies of political culture in the UK.},

Dabei dient die Schweizer Online-Wahlhilfe smartvote als Fallstudie und die Gemeinderats- (Legislative) und Stadtratswahlen (Exekutive) in der Stadt Z{\"{u}}rich vom 9. Februar 2014 als konkretes Anwendungsbeispiel. Neben der Funktionsweise wird auch erl{\"{a}}utert, wie die Benutzung durch Parteien und Kandidierende, Medien sowie W{\"{a}}hler in der Praxis abl{\"{a}}uft. Es wird auch diskutiert, was Online-Wahlhilfen leisten k{\"{o}}nnen. Schlie{\ss}lich wird darauf eingegangen, wo bei der Anwendung dieser Plattformen noch ungenutzte Potenziale stecken und welche Risiken mit ihrem Einsatz verbunden sind. Der Beitrag zeigt, wie smartvote und vergleichbare Projekte idealtypisch im Sinne einer Smart Democracy in Verkn{\"{u}}pfung mit anderen Daten und Instrumenten die Qualit{\"{a}}t einer modernen Demokratie verbessern k{\"{o}}nnen.},

Along with the usual suspects explaining knowledge at the individual level (that is, individual differences in motivation, ability and exposure to political news in the media), this article analyses the extent to which socio-economic, political and communicational contexts affect what people know about politics. More importantly, the article analyses whether information-rich contexts contribute towards reducing inequalities in knowledge. The results are obtained via two-level hierarchical linear models using the 2009 European Election Studies, Voter Study and confirm that citizens' levels of political knowledge are driven by the context. They also demonstrate that information-rich environments crucially narrow knowledge inequalities between high- and low-status citizens. These findings thus suggest that socio-economic policies have the capacity to alter the balance between the information-rich and the information-poor.},

  abstract = {In a recent article in Party Politics, Detlef Jahn proposed an alternative way of generating left--right scores using data from the Comparative Manifestos Project (CMP). Despite presenting innovative ideas, the article requires comment and correction. First, Jahns claim of a deductive approach is not convincing. He proceeds at least partly inductively. Furthermore, he ignores the theoretical ground of the competing approaches. Second, and more importantly, the central criterion by which to evaluate different approaches should be construct validity; however, Jahn does not conduct a full test of the construct validity. In this comment, I first explain the theoretical base of different approaches in generating left--right position scores using CMP. Second, I conduct a test of construct validity using not only expert data but also survey data. The results clearly suggest that approaches using a context-specific scheme for determining left--right issues are superior to the existing alternatives. This comment should be of interest to all scholars concerned with the question of how to create valid party position indicators.},

  abstract = {A criticism of consociational power sharing as an institutional response to violent conflict is that it buttresses rather than ameliorates the underlying (linguistic, religious or ethno-national) divide, hence prohibiting the emergence of new dimensions of political competition (such as economic left-right or moral liberal-conservative dimensions) that are characteristic of normal societies. We test this argument in the context of the illustrative Northern Ireland case, using data from expert coding of party policy documents and opinion data derived from two Voter Advice Applications (VAAs). We find evidence for a moral liberal-conservative dimension of politics in addition to the ethno-national dimension. Hence, we caution against assuming that consociational polities are unidimensional.},

  abstract  = {Experimental research has shown that the choice of response alternatives can influence responses to questions about the frequency of vaguely defined target events (e.g., feeling annoyed); the set of response alternatives is treated as information that contributes to the interpretation of the question. In a series of split ballot experiments we investigate whether such effects occur in a large-scale survey context for sets of response alternatives that might be used interchangeably by survey researchers. The predicted response shifts were found in our field experiments. Those presented with response alternatives discriminating at low frequencies reported fewer of the target episodes than those presented with higher-frequency response alternatives. However, the size of the observed shifts varied from zero to 13 percent and depended on a number of characteristics of the survey, for example, the presence of "priming" questions and the orientation of the response scales. Response alternatives are not neutral and therefore must be carefully considered when constructing a survey question.},

  abstract  = {The primary goal of voting advice applications (VAAs) is to calculate the match between voters' and parties' (or candidates) policy preferences. In order to do so, it is necessary for VAAs to estimate the positions of political parties. In many respects this is a daunting task given that all the commonly used methods for doing so have considerable drawbacks. Most VAAs use a combination of two methods, namely questionnaires sent to parties and expert coding based on party manifestos. The paper will outline the existing approaches in terms of validity and reliability and will propose some improvements in the form of a formal approach to expert coding over multiple rounds with anonymous feedback. The paper will present examples of the advantages of this method using evidence from Choose4Greece, a VAA launched for the May and June 2012 parliamentary elections in Greece.},

Under this paradigm, item-total correlations and exploratory factor analysis are used to provide preliminary scales. The unidimensionality of each scale then is assessed simultaneously with confirmatory factor analysis. After unidimensional measurement has been acceptably achieved, the reliability of each scale is assessed. Additional evidence for construct validity beyond the establishment of unidimensionality then can be provided by embedding the unidimensional sets of indicators within a nomological network defined by the complete structural model.},

In this study, 58 Spanish-English bilinguals completed two gender role attitudes scales---the Attitudes Toward Women Scale (AWS) and the Historic-Sociocultural Premises Scale (HSCP)---with items randomly assigned to be presented in English or Spanish. The HSCP was rated as more meaningful, and participants used more extreme categories in Spanish. Participants rated items on the AWS as more meaningful and used more extreme categories when items were presented in their first language; meaningfulness did not completely account for the latter effect. The results suggest that both language and meaningfulness affect response style. Response style is important not only as a confounding variable in crosscultural research but as an indicator of personal meaning and other culturally related phenomena such as language.},

  abstract  = {This article offers a new test of the mobilisation thesis of Internet effects on individual political participation using data from an NOP survey of 1,972 UK adults during May 2002. The analysis differs from that of previous studies in that it significantly widens the understanding of the dependent variable---online participation---as well as introducing new Internet-specific variables as explanatory factors for this new type of participation. Using this broader contextualised model of online political activity we find support for the idea that the Internet is expanding the numbers of the politically active, specifically in terms of reaching groups that are typically inactive or less active in conventional or offline forms of politics. In drawing these conclusions our article joins with a growing body of literature calling for the re-evaluation of the so-called normalisation thesis which argues that ultimately the Internet will lead to a further narrowing of the pool of politically active citizens by reinforcing existing levels of engagement. At a broader level we consider the findings point to the need for scholars in the area to work towards a more sophisticated theoretical and empirical modelling of participation in the online environment.},

As a nonparametric stochastic version of Guttman scale analysis, the Mokken model provides a useful starting point in scale construction since it does not impose severe restrictions on the functional form of the item trace lines. It requires only that the item trace lines are monotonically increasing and that they do not cross. After describing the Mokken method, we illustrate it by analyzing six abortion items from the 1975--1984 NORC General Social Surveys. In contrast to earlier parametric analyses of these items (regular and probit factor analyses), we find that these items form a single dimension. We argue that the two-dimension solution of these earlier analyses is an artifact of the differences in the difficulty of the items.},

Most investigatiors concerned with response bias appear to believe that these response bias variables act as a form of systematic bias which significantly distorts the relationship observed between an independent and a dependent variable. However, while the literature indicates such a distortion may occur, this has not been demonstrated. Drawing on the data from a national survey, we look at the effect of these three forms of response bias on the pattern of relationships among seven demographic variables (sex, race, education, income, age, marital status, and occupation) and three very different indicators of mental health (psychiatric symptons, self-esteem, and feelings of positive affect). The results lead to an almost unequivocal conclusion: the response bias variables have very little impact on the relationship, and it seems safe to conclude that these sources of response bias do not act in a systematic way to invalidate the pattern of observed relationships between mental health and common demographic variables.},

  abstract = {An automated item selection procedure for selecting unidimensional scales of polytomous items from multi dimensional datasets is developed for use in the context of the Mokken item response theory model of monotone homogeneity (Mokken & Lewis, 1982). The selection procedure is directly based on the selection procedure proposed by Mokken (1971, p. 187) and relies heavily on the scalability coefficient H (Loevinger, 1948; Molenaar, 1991). New theoretical results relating the latent model structure to H are provided. The item selec tion procedure requires selection of a lower bound for H. A simulation study determined ranges of H for which the unidimensional item sets were retrieved from multidimensional datasets. If multidimensionality is suspected in an empirical dataset, well-chosen lower bound values can be used effectively to detect the unidi mensional scales.},

However, response styles like acquiescence and extreme response style may affect answers, particularly on rating scales. In three sets of data from marketing studies, each with representative samples fromat least threeoutofsix countries(Greece,Italy, Spain,France,Germany, andthe United Kingdom), these two response styles were found to be more present in the Mediterranean than in Northwestern Europe. Evidence for response style effects was not only found in response distributions on rating scales, but also in discrepancies of these distributions with national consumer statistics and self-reported actual behavior.},

To answer this question, Hispanic and non-Hispanic subjects were asked to respond to a questionnaire on 5-point or 10-point scales. As predicted, Hispanics were found to exhibit a stronger tendency for extreme checking (about half the time, on the average) than non-Hispanic, but only when the 5-point scales were used. Use of 10-point scales reduced the extreme responses of the Hispanics to the level of non-Hispanics. Extreme responses of non-Hispanics were not affected by the scales. Implications of the findings for social research are discussed.},

In particular, my claim that I use a deductive approach was questioned, it being stressed that other indices are also constructed deductively and that, in turn, my index is not adequately deductive at all. In this response to Simon Franzmanns (2013) comment I stress the advantages and pitfalls of both inductive and deductive approaches. Additionally, I elaborate why I perceive most existing left--right indices as primarily inductive in nature and stress the importance of theory in a deductive approach. I question that a high correlation with other left--right indices is a quality criterion of construct validity. I then correct some misinterpretations fostered by Franzmann and summarize the logic of my index. Finally, I give two brief examples of the merit and analytical potential of a deductive left--right score.},

This study combines data on the public's knowledge of nearly 50 political issues with media coverage of those topics. In a two-part analysis, we demonstrate how education, the strongest and most consistent predictor of political knowledge, has a more nuanced connection to learning than is commonly recognized. Sometimes education is positively related to knowledge. In other instances its effect is negligible. A substantial part of the variation in the education-knowledge relationship is due to the amount of information available in the mass media. This study is among the first to distinguish the short-term, aggregate-level influences on political knowledge from the largely static individual-level predictors and to empirically demonstrate the importance of the information environment.},

  abstract  = {Voting advice applications (VAAs) are intelligent systems that provide personalized recommendations of political candidate/party to a voter with regard to her/his political attitudes. The existing gaps related to the improvements of the system design will be addressed in this paper. The paper presents a trust-aware Voting Advice Application which aims to improve the recommendation accuracy, in this way to facilitate voter's decision-making processes and enhance citizens' participation in eDemocracy. By establishing the candidates-to-voters communication via the forum channel, alternatively to traditional VAAs, the proposed system calculates the similarity of political profiles between voters and candidates including into the computation the candidates' reputation based on her/his behaviour within the forum. To test the proposed prototype, the evaluation framework has been designed, and a user study has been conducted. The results show that trust-aware VAAs give satisfactorily accurate and helpful recommendations. Furthermore, causal relationships of the evaluated constructs demonstrate that by participating in forum discussions, a user can improve the accuracy of her/his recommendation that is further helpful in her/his decision-making processes.},

First, it provides an overview of the political parties in the various countries and classifies them by party family. Second, it deals with three aspects of inter-party competition which have been singled out as important by previous research efforts: (1) the number of political parties (fragmentation), (2) the ideological distance between parties (polarization), and (3) the degree of electoral change (volatility). Measures of these characteristics allow a basic description of the structure and dynamics of party systems.},

Since value orientations can be considered as long-term factors, one should expect the explanatory power of value orientations to decline over time. However, the empirical evidence in this chapter suggests that the impact of values is regulated by the political context. This contextual factor includes the extent to which citizens learn to make use of ideological labels and concepts, the extent to which they receive ideological cues in order to choose on the basis of values, as well as the affective strength with which values are endorsed. The apparent decrease in perceived party polarisation in the 1990s led to a decline of the extent to which extremely economic left-right values matter for party choice.},

  abstract  = {Although left-right items are a standard tool of public opinion research, there is little agreement about the optimal response format. Two disputes can be identified in the literature: (1) whether to provide respondents with a small or large number of answer categories, and (2) whether or not to administer the response scale including a midpoint. This study evaluates the performance of the 101, 11, and 10-point left-right scales, which directly speak to the two disputed aspects of measuring the left-right dimension. Drawing on data from a split ballot multitrait multimethod experiment carried out in a methodological pretest to the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), the analysis shows that the choice of a response format makes a difference in terms of data quality: the 11-point left-right scale produces the highest validity of left-right data closely followed by the 10-point scale. Moreover, an application from electoral research illustrates that the choice of response formats affects substantive interpretations about the nature of the left-right dimension. Since all three scales perform about equally well in terms of reliability and the ease of administration, the findings suggest that the 11-point left-right scale should be used in survey research.},

  abstract = {Recent research documents the widespread use of heuristics, especially a reliance on elite cues among citizens. Scholars have celebrated this mode of decision making as rational and effective. Using experimental survey data collected from white and African-American respondents, we also identify what appears to be a strong influence of elite messages on mass political judgments, but only among our black respondents. More importantly, the data reveal some of the perils of cue-taking. Although rational, this heuristic may not always be effective.},

  abstract = {Models with structured additive predictor provide a very broad and rich framework for complex regression modeling. They can deal simultaneously with nonlinear covariate effects and time trends, unit- or cluster-specific heterogeneity, spatial heterogeneity and complex interactions between covariates of different type. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical or multilevel version of regression models with structured additive predictor where the regression coefficients of a particular nonlinear term may obey another regression model with structured additive predictor. In that sense, the model is composed of a hierarchy of complex structured additive regression models. The proposed model may be regarded as an extended version of a multilevel model with nonlinear covariate terms in every level of the hierarchy. The model framework is also the basis for generalized random slope modeling based on multiplicative random effects. Inference is fully Bayesian and based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques. We provide an in depth description of several highly efficient sampling schemes that allow to estimate complex models with several hierarchy levels and a large number of observations within a couple of minutes (often even seconds). We demonstrate the practicability of the approach in a complex application on childhood undernutrition with large sample size and three hierarchy levels.},

We suggest a more realistic standard: Citizens fulfill their democratic duties if, most of the time, they vote "correctly." Relying on an operationalization of correct voting based on fully informed interests, we present experimental data showing that, most of the time, people do indeed manage to vote correctly. We also show that voters' determinations of their correct vote choices can be predicted reasonably well with widely available survey data. We illustrate how this measure can be used to determine the proportion of the electorate voting correctly, which we calculate at about 75\% for the five American presidential elections between 1972 and 1988. With a standard for correct vote decisions, political science can turn to exploring the factors that make it more likely that people will vote correctly.},

  abstract  = {This article challenges the often untested assumption that cognitive "heuristics" improve the decision-making abilities of everyday voters. The potential benefits and costs of five common political heuristics are discussed. A new dynamic process-tracing methodology is employed to directly observe the use of these five heuristics by voters in a mock presidential election campaign. We find that cognitive heuristics are at times employed by almost all voters and that they are particularly likely to be used when the choice situation facing voters is complex. A hypothesized interaction between political sophistication and heuristic use on the quality of decision making is obtained across several different experiments, however. As predicted, heuristic use generally increases the probability of a correct vote by political experts but decreases the probability of a correct vote by novices. A situation in which experts can be led astray by heuristic use is also illustrated. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for strategies to increase input from under-represented groups into the political process.},

As predicted, the norm led in nearly 8 per cent to agree with both statements despite their highly contradictory character. This raises serious questions concerning the validity of the A-scale and concerning the interpretation of the F-scale. This study serves as yet another reminder that the research interview invariably creates a social relationship with consequences of importance forthe interpretation of data.},

  abstract  = {This chapter demonstrates that the European voter is also an economic voter in the sense that negative evaluations of the economy hurt the electoral fortunes of incumbent parties. For those who expected that economic voting would be on the rise, the empirical results are disappointing. Systematic trends towards an increase in economic voting were not observed. Political events and institutional factors account for some of the variations in economic voting. For instance, the weak and irregular effects in Norway can be explained by the dominance of minority governments, a weak opposition, and the EU issue which dominated over economic concerns and probably reduced Labours ability to benefit from the first stage of the economic recovery in the 1993 election. Similarly, under a different institutional context, the British Conservative party in 1997 had less success than Labour four years later in taking advantage of an improving economy. These examples may suggest that institutions as well as embedded effects of political events influence the impact of economic evaluations on the vote.},

  abstract  = {A common concern when faced with multivariate data with missing values is whether the missing data are missing completely at random (MCAR); that is, whether missingness depends on the variables in the data set. One way of assessing this is to compare the means of recorded values of each variable between groups defined by whether other variables in the data set are missing or not. Although informative, this procedure yields potentially many correlated statistics for testing MCAR, resulting in multiple-comparison problems. This article proposes a single global test statistic for MCAR that uses all of the available data. The asymptotic null distribution is given, and the small-sample null distribution is derived for multivariate normal data with a monotone pattern of missing data. The test reduces to a standard t test when the data are bivariate with missing data confined to a single variable. A limited simulation study of empirical sizes for the test applied to normal and nonnormal data suggests that the test is conservative for small samples.},

  abstract  = {Voters in mass elections are notorious for their apparent lack of information about relevant political matters. While some scholars argue that an electorate of well-informed voters is necessary for the production of responsive electoral outcomes, others argue that apparently ignorant voters will suffice because they can adapt their behavior to the complexity of electoral choice. To evaluate the validity of these arguments, I develop and analyze a survey of California voters who faced five complicated insurance reform ballot initiatives. I find that access to a particular class of widely available information shortcuts allowed badly informed voters to emulate the behavior of relatively well informed voters. This finding is suggestive of the conditions under which voters who lack encyclopedic information about the content of electoral debates can nevertheless use information shortcuts to vote as though they were well informed.},

We examine how informant selection and post-survey response aggregation influence the validity and reliability of measures built from informant observations. We draw upon three surveys with parallel survey questions of candidate characteristics to examine the trade-off between expanding the size of the local informant pool and the pools level of expertise. We find that a wisdom-of-crowds effect trumps the benefits associated with the expertise of individual informants when the size of the rater pool is modestly increased. We demonstrate that the benefits of expertise are best realized by prescreening potential informants for expertise rather than post-survey weighting by expertise.},

  abstractnote = {This address advances three ideas. First, political science as a discipline has a mandate to help human beings govern themselves. Second, within this mandate we should be focusing, more than we do now, on creating legitimate coercion. In a world of increasing interdependence we now face an almost infinite number of collective action problems created when something we need or want involves a free-access good. We need coercion to solve these collective action problems. The best coercion is normatively legitimate coercion. Democratic theory, however, has focused more on preventing tyranny than on how to legitimate coercion. Finally, our discipline has neglected an important source of legitimate coercion: negotiation to agreement. Recognizing the central role of negotiation in politics would shed a different light on our relatively unexamined democratic commitments to transparency in process and contested elections. This analysis is overall both descriptive and aspirational, arguing that helping human beings to govern themselves has been in the DNA of our profession since its inception.},

Results are fairly consistent in showing that Hispanics prefer extreme responses to a greater extent than non-Hispanic Whites. In general, Hispanics prefer to agree with a given item more than non-Hispanic Whites. Two significant variables seem to affect the rate at which these response styles are chosen. First, the level of acculturation among Hispanics affects the level of extreme and acquiescent responses so that as Hispanics acculturate they tend to choose these types of response less frequently. The less educated respondents (less than 12 years of formal education) tend to make more extreme choices than the more highly educated (those with at least a secondary education). Gender does not affect these response sets in a consistent fashion.},

  abstract  = {To cast a meaningful ballot, voters ought to have sufficient knowledge of competing parties. As parties often change between elections (for example, merge, split), they breed electoral complexity, with potential consequences for voter ability to take party cues and make informed decisions. Owing to the demands placed on their attention and cognition, voters are generally less capable of taking party cues as parties erratically transform. This finding has several nuances: the impact of party instability depends both on its type and overall degree, as well as on voters' disparate abilities to handle electoral complexity. First, voters tend to know considerably less about new parties and splinters than they do about preexisting parties; yet they are more knowledgeable about newly formed mergers and joint lists. Second, voters who experience only occasional peaks in instability are more adversely affected than voters in new, fluid party systems. Lastly as instability increases, the positive effect of education on political knowledge diminishes, suggesting that even the well-educated have difficulty sorting through electoral alternatives as parties change. The overall loss in knowledge associated with high instability speaks to the important role political parties have in facilitating the acquisition of electoral information and for political representation more broadly.},

A distinction is drawn between construction and evaluation of a test (or scale) on the one hand and the use of a test to measure and make decisions about persons' abilities on the other. Techniques to deal with each of these aspects are described and illustrated with examples.},

In this study a number of alternative designs for online questionnaire presentation were investigated. A long heterogeneous survey was partitioned in four ways: whole form, semantic sections, screen pages and single items. Questionnaires were presented with or without an index, resulting in eight versions. Neither initial completion times nor subjective assessments differed among the eight versions due to the highly linear navigation of the surveys. Respondents were asked to revisit 16 questions based on the topic of the question or on the question number and to change their answers. Revision times reflected ease of finding items in the structure of the survey and the use of an index to the sections of the questionnaire.},

According to most of the dominant literature, the explanatory power of this model has declined over time. This trend is confirmed in this chapter. However, the findings in this chapter also show that social cleavage voting must be seen as the result of an interaction between groups in society on the one hand, and the political parties on the other. Changes in party appeal or party strategies are important factors to consider to understand the evolution of social cleavage voting.},

It demonstrates that while anti-corruption salience is primarily related to the (regional) context in which a party operates, anti-elite salience is primarily a function of party ideology. Extreme left and extreme conservative (TAN) parties are significantly more likely to emphasize anti-elite views. Through its use of the new 2014 Chapel Hill Expert Survey wave, this article also introduces the dataset.},

  abstract = {Measures of household socio-economic position (SEP) are widely used in health research. There exist a number of approaches to their measurement, with Principal Components Analysis (PCA) applied to a basket of household assets being one of the most common. PCA, however, carries a number of assumptions about the distribution of the data which may be untenable, and alternative, non-parametric, approaches may be preferred. Mokken scale analysis is a non-parametric, item response theory approach to scale development which appears never to have been applied to household asset data. A Mokken scale can be used to rank order items (measures of wealth) as well as households. Using data on household asset ownership from a national sample of 4,154 consenting households in the World Health Survey from Vietnam, 2003, we construct two measures of household SEP. Seventeen items asking about assets, and utility and infrastructure use were used. Mokken Scaling and PCA were applied to the data. A single item measure of total household expenditure is used as a point of contrast.},

It is ar gued that Loevinger's H, adapted by Mokken and ad vocated as a coefficient of scalability, is sensitive to properties of the item set which are extraneous to Mokken's requirement of holomorphy of item re sponse curves. Therefore, when defined in terms of H, the Mokken scale is ambiguous. It is furthermore ar gued that item-selection free statistical inferences con ceming the latent person order appear to be insuffi ciently based on double monotony alone, and that the Rasch model is the only item response model fulfilling this requirement. Finally, it is contended that the Mokken scale is an unfruitful compromise between the requirements of a Guttman scale and the requirements of classical test theory.},

  abstract  = {Most studies of party competition consider the presentation of ambiguous positions a costly strategy. This literature, however, does not study party strategies in multiple issue dimensions. Yet multidimensionality may play an important role in parties strategic calculus. Although it may be rational for a party to emphasize a certain issue dimension, it may be equally rational to disguise its stance on other dimensions by blurring its position. This article argues that parties employ strategies of issue emphasis and position blurring in various dimensional contexts. Who emphasizes and who blurs thus depends on the actors relative stakes in different issue dimensions. The paper makes its case by performing cross-sectional analyses of 132 political parties in 14 West European party systems using Comparative Manifesto Project data, the 2006 Chapel Hill expert survey and the 2009 European Election Study.},

  abstract     = {Consistent voting is a precondition for the working of accountability. This chapter investigates the conditions under which correct voting is more likely. The results demonstrate that whether voters make sound choices at the polls depends not only on their own motivational and cognitive resources. Although in quite complex ways, turning to external sources of political information may considerably improve their odds of voting consistently. Delegating the costs of obtaining, analysing, and evaluating information to sources available within their social environments pays off for voters---at least as long as they make the right choices when selecting their sources.},

Claims that direct legislation elections overwhelm voters with choices they are not competent to make should particularly apply to such demanding settings. Yet, evidence on the effects of lengthy ballots on voting behavior is scant. This study reviews theories of decision-making under uncertainty, and tests their predictions in a mixed heteroscedastic model of vote choice that is fitted to a unique collection of survey and contextual data on Swiss referendums. Increasing ballot length is demonstrated to interfere with the voters' ability to translate their political preferences into consistent policy choices.},

The objectives of this study are to first to rank the visualizations of the opinion mining systems and second to identify important visualization metrics. A questionnaire survey was designed to ask users their level of agreement or disagreement about the 11 selected visualizations against a set of information visualization metrics on a Likert scale. The data were collected by conducting seminars and using a web-based online questionnaire (N0.167em=0.167em146). The collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and an independent sample t-test to rank the visualizations and investigate differences between perceptions of the two groups of respondents (the participants of the seminars and the online questionnaire), respectively. The results revealed that simple, eye pleasing, easy to understand, user-friendly visualizations with less pre-knowledge required rated higher than others. It is concluded that the participants of the online questionnaire mostly required more pre-knowledge to comprehend the visualizations as compared to the participants of the seminars. The important information visualization metrics are eye pleasing, easy to understand, user-friendly, informative design, usefulness, and representation style. The results of this study could aid in the design and development of visualizations for opinion mining systems.},

  abstract  = {Recent work on graph perception has focused on the nature of the processes that operate when people decode the information represented in graphs. We began our investigations by gathering evidence that people have generic expectations about what types of information will be the major messages in various types of graphs. These graph schemata suggested how graph type and judgment type would interact to determine the speed and accuracy of quantitative information extraction. These predictions were confirmed by the finding that a comparison judgment was most accurate when the judgment required assessing position along a common scale (simple bar chart), had intermediate accuracy on length judgments (divided bar chart), and was least accurate when assessing angles (pie chart). In contrast, when the judgment was an estimate of the proportion of the whole, angle assessments (pie chart) were as accurate as position (simple bar chart) and more accurate than length (divided bar chart). Proposals for elementary information processes involving anchoring, scanning, projection, superimposition, and detection operators were made to explain this interaction.},

  abstract = {Mokken scaling techniques are a useful tool for researchers who wish to construct unidimensional tests or use questionnaires that comprise multiple binary or polytomous items. The stochastic cumulative scaling model offered by this approach is ideally suited when the intention is to score an underlying latent trait by simple addition of the item response values. In our experience, the Mokken model appears to be less well-known than for example the (related) Rasch model, but is seeing increasing use in contemporary clinical research and public health. Mokken's method is a generalisation of Guttman scaling that can assist in the determination of the dimensionality of tests or scales, and enables consideration of reliability, without reliance on Cronbach's alpha. This paper provides a practical guide to the application and interpretation of this non-parametric item response theory method in empirical research with health and well-being questionnaires.},

  abstract  = {Mokken scale analysis uses an automated bottom-up stepwise item selection procedure that suffers from two problems. First, when selected during the procedure items satisfy the scaling conditions but they may fail to do so after the scale has been completed. Second, the procedure is approximate and thus may not produce the optimal item partitioning. This study investigates a variation on Mokken's item selection procedure, which alleviates the first problem, and proposes a genetic algorithm, which alleviates both problems. The genetic algorithm is an approximation to checking all possible partitionings. A simulation study shows that the genetic algorithm leads to better scaling results than the other two procedures.},

Previous studies have linked the prevalence and severity of lung disease with national wealth and with socio-economic position within some countries but there has been no systematic evaluation of the association between lung function and poverty at the individual level on a global scale. The BOLD study has collected data on lung function for individuals in a wide range of countries, however a barrier to relating this to personal socio-economic position is the need for a suitable measure to compare individuals within and between countries. In this paper we test a method for assessing socio-economic position based on the scalability of a set of durable assets (Mokken scaling), and compare its usefulness across countries of varying gross national income per capita.},

Results clearly show a structured heterogeneity that is an answer of voters to complexity of the context of voting. Voters are rather on the move looking for ways to cope with complexity than on the run away from politics. The implication for the understanding of the working of democracy is that just looking at the voters can only contribute little to the understanding of election outcomes. An integrated approach of electoral research needs to take into account the contingencies of voting behavior on political supply.},

  abstract  = {Congressional campaigns do not occur in isolation, but concurrently with many other races. What are the effects of overlapping campaigns for how people learn about congressional candidates? On one hand, intensely fought races on the same ballot may encourage people to extend interest to contemporaneous races. Alternatively, competing campaigns may distract voters and limit learning about down-ticket contests. Using American National Election Studies data from 1996 to 2002, I test the consequences of state level presidential, senatorial, and gubernatorial campaign intensity on citizen learning about congressional candidates. I find that while the local intensity of the presidential race has little effect on knowledge of House candidates, the intensity of the Senate race is positively associated with candidate recognition. These effects vary depending on the nature of the election, where House candidates benefit from intense Senate races on the ballot particularly in midterm election years.},

Mathematical theories are explored to enlighten students on how exploratory factor analysis works, an example of how to run an exploratory factor analysis on SPSS is given, and finally a section on how to write up the results is provided. This will allow readers to develop a better understanding of when to employ factor analysis and how to interpret the tables and graphs in the output.},

Using these two principles, my colleagues and I have extended a variety of analysis procedures originally proposed for quantitative (interval or ratio) data to qualitative (nominal or ordinal) data, including additivity analysis and analysis of variance; multiple and canonical regression; principal components; common factor and three mode factor analysis; and multidimensional scaling. The approach has two advantages: (a) If a least squares procedure is known for analyzing quantitative data, it can be extended to qualitative data; and (b) the resulting algorithm will be convergent. Three completely worked through examples of the additivity analysis procedure and the steps involved in the regression procedures are presented.},

In Experiment 1, respondents completed multiple measures of attitude strength. Three weeks later, respondents participated in a context experiment. Results revealed that respondents with weak attitudes exhibited significantly larger context effect for 1 of 2 issues. In Experiment 2, the results of Experiment 1 were conceptually replicated by use of measures of interattitudinal embeddedness to assess attitude strength. In Experiment 3, significant strength-moderated context effects were found when attitude strength was assessed in a multi-item, multidimensional manner but not when it was assessed with a single item. Discussion focuses on measurement and theoretical issues related to the moderation and mediation of context effects in attitude surveys.},

Mit diesem Aufsatz schlagen wir eine vierte idealtypische Phase der Wahlkampfkampagne vor. Diese vierte Phase setzt sich von den vorherigen Phasen durch die intensivierte Nutzung neuer Kommunikationstechnologien, quantitative Datenanalyse und auf unmittelbarem Austausch basierende Kommunikationsparadigmen ab. Ein weiterer Fokus liegt in dieser Phase auf dem neu entstandenen Verh{\"{a}}ltnis zwischen B{\"{u}}rgern und Politik, in dem der Zugang zur Kampagnenf{\"{u}}hrung niedrigschwelliger ist und die emotionale Bindung in den Vordergrund ger{\"{u}}ckt wird. Ver{\"{a}}nderte Nachfrage, Anwendung und Produktion von Medien stellen die zentralen Entwicklungen in dieser Phase dar. Im Spannungsfeld zwischen B{\"{u}}rger und Medien ordnen wir den Hauptimpuls f{\"{u}}r den Wandel ein. Die neue Phase, die wir als Mediatisierte Kampagne bezeichnen, hebt die Rolle der Medien hervor und macht auf die damit verbundenen Entwicklungen in politischen und gesellschaftlichen Institutionen aufmerksam. Dieser Ansatz verleiht k{\"{u}}nftiger Wahlkampfforschung eine koh{\"{a}}rente Struktur und weist eine potenzielle Forschungsrichtung aus.},

  abstract = {Vote Compass -- an online voter education tool originating in Canada -- was used for the first time in New Zealand during the 2014 general election. During its inaugural run, over 330,000 New Zealanders visited the Vote Compass website to answer 30 policy- or issue-based questions. In return, respondents received a report on how close their views were to 10 political parties seeking office. Due to the large sample size, these data provided Television New Zealand with unique insights into voters views that could also be related to party policies and campaign events by academic commentators. After explaining the nature of the tool and describing the composition of the New Zealand-based team, this article examines the implications that Vote Compass has for party responsiveness and political marketing. In particular, we note the importance of Vote Compass not just for market-oriented policy, but for the overall leadership brand, including its ability to deliver on promised goods. The article also reflects on the contribution that the tool makes to voter engagement and democracy in general. Lastly, it provides a summary of the overall Vote Compass data from the main survey items and marketing-related post-election survey data in an appendix for academics to use in their own research and teaching in future.},

For our analysis, we draw on data generated by a three-wave panel study roughly representative for the German online-population which was exclusively designed to study effects of the Wahl-O-Mat during the 2014 European Elections campaign. By analyzing the intra-individual change of Wahl-O-Mat users and non-users concerning their interest, knowledge and participation, we are able to track the mobilization potential of election campaigning and whether the VAA use has reinforcing effects on this potential. Empirical findings of the three-wave panel study indicate that indeed during the campaign an increase in campaign interest can be found and a slight increase in political knowledge and the willingness to participate in the elections.},

The paper contributes empirically to this debate by analyzing the effect of a popular online application, "Wahl-O-Mat", on voting intention at the 2009 German Federal Election. The findings support the mobilization thesis. Inwiefern politische Online-Kommunikation auf die politische Beteiligung wirkt, wird kontrovers diskutiert: W{\"{a}}hrend die Normalisierungsthese davon ausgeht, dass Internet-Kommunikation bestehende Partizipationsungleichheiten zementiert, besagt die Mobilisierungsthese, dass Online-Kommunikation in der Lage ist, zuvor politikferne Gruppen zur Beteiligung zu bewegen. Die Studie leistet einen empirischen Beitrag zu dieser Kontroverse, in dem sie die Wirkungen einer popul{\"{a}}ren Internet-Applikation, des Wahl-O-Mat", auf die Wahlbeteiligungsabsicht bei der Bundestagswahl 2009 analysiert.

  abstract  = {During recent election campaigns non-partisan party profile websites (PPWs) have become hugely popular in various countries with multiparty systems, sometimes even attracting 25 percent of all voters. On these interactive websites, PPW users respond to policy questions, and their answers are used to calculate the distance between their own preferences and party agendas, resulting in an individualized `party profile'. PPWs can be seen as one of the few innovations in election campaigning that fully exploit the internet's interactive opportunities. The analysis in this article of the log files of 2003 and 2004 Belgian PPWs demonstrate that PPW users tend to be highly educated, male and young. Party and policy preferences of late PPW users (the final days before the elections) are not more crystallized than those of early PPW users (40 days before the elections). The article concludes with speculation on what this finding might reveal about campaign dynamics.},

The bail-out came with memoranda that set the main lines of Greek economic policy for the coming years. Accepting these policies was connected with remaining in the Eurozone. This restructured the political space: the economic and European integration form one dimension. A second relevant dimension focuses on cultural issues. The economic/European dimension is a stronger predictor of vote choice than the cultural dimension.},

The analysis of issue voting is of central importance in empirical electoral research. In this context, policy positions of voters and parties are normally surveyed by means of bipolar policy scales developed within the spatial model of voting. Even if such policy scales are widespread, their use can be criticised for a series of theoretical and methodological reasons. Beyond this background, conjoint measurement of policy preferences is presented as an alternative mode of operationalization. Using data from a methodological experiment it is shown that (full profile) conjoint measurement is superior to the use of traditional policy scales in the proximity and the directional model of voting.},

Studies indicate that lack of information and cost-benefit considerations cause voters to abstain from voting. VAAs are online voting assistance tools which match own political preferences with those of candidates and parties in elections. By assisting voters in their decision-making process prior to casting their votes, VAAs not only rebut rational choice reasoning against voting but also narrow existing information gaps. In this paper we examine the impact of VAAs on participation and voter turnout. Specifically, we present results on how the Swiss VAA smartvote affected voter turnout in the 2007 federal elections. Our analyses suggest that smartvote does have a mobilizing capacity, especially among young voters who are usually underrepresented at polls. Moreover, the study demonstrates how VAAs such as smartvote do affect citizen's propensity to deal with politics in general.},

This paper investigates the oft-overlooked requirement of attractiveness (or aesthetics) in visualization, and, in doing so, discusses a wider role for the design process which emphasizes the benefits of disseminating design rationale. In presenting a model of three potential roles for design in information visualization, we suggest that the field would benefit from encompassing a broader scope that includes visualizations produced as part of commercial practice or artistic exploration. We conclude with a discussion on the practical consequences to the academic community of adopting our model -- consequences that will require a paradigm shift in the way we value, teach and conduct information visualization research.},

These predictions are analysed with new data from a 2000 mail survey that asked congressional candidates to place themselves on a left-right ideological scale. The data reveal that candidates often diverge, but that the degree of candidate polarization is variable and may be explained by factors in the theory. Candidates with firm public reputations, those who face weak general election competition, and those who experience stiff primary competition are all more likely to deviate from the median voter's position. Perhaps more importantly, the locations that candidates adopt have clear effects on their vote shares.},

We detected this specificity as a dominance of vertical and horizontal saccades of eye movements in perception processes of all groups of participants.

Furthermore, a lot of evidences of shortening of the perception actions from novices to experts are presented.},

We discuss nine such features. We also review the literature that recommends how scatterplots should be prepared, and we examine 221 scatterplots published in recent journals. There was considerable variation among those published scatterplots. This article concludes with a call for further standardization by way of flexible guidelines.},

Computer graphics have stimulated interest in the perceptual pros and cons of different formats for displaying data. One way of evaluating the effectiveness of a display is to measure theefficiency (as defined by signal-detection theory) with which an observer extracts information from the graph. We measured observers' efficiencies in detecting differences in the means or variances of pairs of data sets sampled from Gaussian distributions. Sample size ranged from 1 to 20 for viewing times of 0.3 or 1 sec. The samples were displayed in three formats: numerical tables, scatterplots, and luminance-coded displays. Efficiency was highest for the scatterplots ($\cong$60\% for both means and variances) and was only weakly dependent on sample size and exposure time. The pattern of results suggests parallel perceptual computation in which a constant proportion of the available information is used. Efficiency was lowest for the numerical tables and depended more strongly on sample size and viewing time. The results suggest serial processing in which a fixed amount of the available information is processed in a given time.},

Applying factor analysis and Mokken Scale Analysis to opinion data generated from a Voting Advice Application deployed in England in the run-up to the European parliamentary elections, I show how individual issues may be aggregated into two principal dimensions: an economic dimension that separates Left and Right in terms of the economy and a cultural communitarian--cosmopolitan dimension. I also identify a third (libertarian--authoritarian) dimension, but this appears to aggregate very few issues. By positioning party supporters on a two-dimensional map defined by the two principal dimensions, I show that United Kingdom Independence Party supporters are situated very near the `communitarian' pole of the cultural communitarian--cosmopolitan dimension. Finally, I show that overall, the communitarian--cosmopolitan dimension forms a rather more coherent scale than the Left--Right dimension and this tendency is even more marked among younger voters and voters with little interest in politics. Overall, this would appear to show that the notion of (economic) Left and Right is losing its salience in English politics.},

  abstract = {This article analyses the dimensionality and nature of political conflict in the European Union Council of Ministers between 1998 and 2007. By comparing policy platforms of member state governments, multidimensional scaling techniques are employed to make inferences about the dimensionality of the Councils political space. The dimensions are interpreted performing 1250 multiple regression analyses. The results largely corroborate the assumption that cleavages are structured along geographically defined clusters of states. After Eastern enlargement (2004), a North---South divide was replaced by an East---West cleavage. The analysis moreover suggests that there are two stable conflict dimensions within the Councils political space. The first is an integration dimension that represents the support for deepening European Union integration and the transfer of sovereignty to a supranational level. The second is a policy dimension, manifested predominantly in disputes over redistributive policies.},

  abstract = {Theories of issue evolution and issue manipulation suggest that political losers in the party system can advance their position by introducing a new issue dimension. According to these theories, a strategy of issue entrepreneurship, that is the attempt to restructure political competition by mobilizing a previously non-salient issue dimension, allows political losers to attract new voters and reap electoral gains. In this study, we examine the extent to which these expectations hold by exploring issue entrepreneurial strategies of political parties when applied to the issue of European integration. Using multi-level modelling to analyse European Election Study data, we first show that voters are more likely to cast their ballot for parties that are losers on the extant dimension based on concerns related to European integration. Secondly, a time-series cross-sectional analysis demonstrates that parties that employ an issue entrepreneurial strategy are more successful electorally. Put differently, voters are responsive to the issue entrepreneurial strategies of parties. These findings have important implications for our understanding of party competition and electoral behaviour in multi-party systems.},

The European Union is often said to be devoid of these choices owing to minor policy differences between parties. The manifestos issued at European Parliament elections by party groups are often perceived as being bland and indistinguishable from each other. How correct is this perception? In this article, the diversity of policy positions within and between the main European party groups is analyzed by means of the European election manifestos of 1999. The content analysis of these manifestos shows that there are significant differences both within and between the party groups. These differences indicate that these groups are (potentially) able to present meaningful choices to voters.},

After clarifying the concept of dimensionality, I review the existing literature. I then map out possible ways to test these models based on different dimensionality assumptions. Using quantitative data on actor positions for EU legislative politics, I .rst employ dimension-reducing techniques. The results show that this technique is not appropriate for generating a decreased number of underlying dimensions for the data at hand and that a one- or two-dimensional European policy space cannot be detected. Shifting to more theory-based analysis, I calculate the predicted outcomes for voting models of the EU under different spatial con.gurations. The findings show that the formal models predictive power increases with the use of multi-dimensional policy spaces. I conclude by interpreting these findings in the light of a more general debate on evaluating the decision space assumed bymodels of group decision-making.},

I also show that these dimensions are not characteristic of just a few systems but rather divide parties significantly in most or all of the 16 countries examined.},

Conversely, some apparently unidimensional cases are found to be better described as multidimensional. Particular attention is given to the difference between multidimensional scaling and factor analysis. The philosophical implication of our dependence on the definition of unidimensionality is that scaling seeks only partial images of a real world that may be fundamentally unknowable.},

It demonstrates that a mathematical relationship between the number of electoral parties and the literatures concept of dimensionality follows from the variables definitions; conversely, it argues that exploring the relationship between the number of electoral parties and a different concept of dimensionality conveys new information. Hence, it first argues that how we conceptualize dimensionality matters. Redirecting attention to the latter relationship, it then hypothesizes that party system fragmentation will go hand-in-hand with the appearance of new conflicts on the political agenda when the electoral system is permissive. Using a time-series cross-sectional dataset that includes at its core a new measure of dimensionality, it finds reasonable support for the hypotheses; however, at the elite level, new parties are found to play less of a role in politicizing new conflicts than expected.},

We propose a functional distinction between tasks: those that require shape understanding versus those that require precise judgments of relative position. The distortions inherent in 3D displays hamper judging relative positions, whereas the integration of dimensions in 3D displays facilitates shape understanding. We confirmed these hypotheses with two initial experiments involving simple block shapes. The shape-understanding tasks were identification or mental rotation. The relative-position tasks were locating shadows and determining directions and distances between objects. We then extended the results to four experiments involving complex natural terrain. We compare our distinction with the integral/separable task distinction of Haskel and Wickens (1993). Applications for this research include displays for air traffic control, geoplots for military command and control, and potentially, any display of 3D information.},

They were originally intended to maximise effective use of available screen space and to better exploit the abilities of the human perceptual system. Prior work has focused on the fidelity of the visualisation rather than providing empirical user studies. This paper describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a lowfidelity animated and rapidly interactive 3D cone tree system. Results of the evaluation show that our subjects were slower at locating data using cone trees than when using a `normal' tree browser, and that their performance deteriorated rapidly as the branching factor of the data-structure increased. Qualitative results, however, indicate that the subjects were enthusiastic about the cone tree visualisation and that they felt it provided a better `feel' for the structure of the information space.},

  abstract = {When university academics implement changes in learning, such as introducing blended learning, it is conventional practice to examine and evaluate the impact of the resulting curriculum reform. Judging the worth and impact of an educational development is a complex task involving subtle differences in learning. Qualitative methods to explore these deep processes in learning include using interviews, observations and open-ended questionnaires targeting all stakeholders in the process, such as students, teachers, administration and technical staff. These evaluation tasks generate a mass of raw data that many faculty members in higher education are unaccustomed to analyzing. This article provides a framework using radar charts adapted from the field of organizational development. A modified six-zone radar chart was used to assess the extent of blended learning in order to compare changes in the learning environment. Data collection included interviews, classroom observations and electronic records generated during educational delivery over a 1-year period of time. A purposeful sample of online course data was collected by three participating universities in South Africa, Australia, and the United States.},

  abstract  = {Spatial characterizations of agents preferences lie at the heart of many theories of political competition. These give rise to explicitly dimensional interpretations. Parties define and differentiate themselves in terms of substantive policy issues, and the configuration of such issues that is required for a good description of political competition affects how we think substantively about the underlying political space in which parties compete. For this reason a great deal of activity in political science consists of estimating such configurations in particular real settings. We focus on three main issues in this article. First, we discuss the nature of political differences and from this construct an interpretation of the dimensionality of the political space needed to describe a given real setting, underscoring the essentially metaphorical and instrumental use of this concept. Second, we contrast ex ante and ex post interpretations of this dimensionality. Third, we illustrate potential hazards arising from the purely inductive estimation of political spaces using a spatial example from the physical world and political competition in the European Parliament as a political example.},

  abstract = {For decades, survey researchers have known that respondents give different answers to attitude questions worded positively (X is good. Agree-Disagree), negatively (X is bad. Agree-Disagree) or on a bipolar scale (X is bad-good). This makes survey answers hard to interpret, especially since findings on exactly how the answers are affected are conflicting. In the current paper, we present twelve studies in which the effect of question polarity was measured for a set of thirteen contrastive adjectives. In each study, the same adjectives were used so the generalizability of wording effects across studies could be examined for each word pair. Results show that for five of the word pairs an effect of question wording can be generalized. The direction of these effects are largely consistent: respondents generally give the same answers to positive and bipolar questions, but they are more likely to disagree with negative questions than to agree with positive questions or to choose the positive side of the bipolar scale. In other words, respondents express their opinions more positively when the question is worded negatively. Even though answers to the three wording alternatives sometimes differ, results also show that reliable answers can be obtained with all three wording alternatives. So, for survey practice, these results suggest that all three wording alternatives may be used for attitude measurement.},

  abstract  = {Research on graph comprehension has been concerned with relatively low-level information extraction. However, laboratory studies often produce conflicting findings because real-world graph interpretation requires going beyond the data presentation to make inferences and solve problems. Furthermore, in real-world settings, graphical information is presented in the context of relevant prior knowledge. According to our model, knowledge-based graph comprehension involves an interaction of top-down and bottom up processes. Several types of knowledge are brought to bear on graphs: domain knowledge, graphical skills, and explanatory skills. During the initial processing, people chunk the visual features in the graphs. Nevertheless, prior knowledge guides the processing of visual features. We outline the key assumptions of this model and show how this model explains the extant data and generates testable predictions.},

We describe two experiments demonstrating that the representations constructed by people reasoning about graphs may also possess this spatial quality.

We propose that current models of graph comprehension have not needed to incorporate spatial processes, because most of the task/graph combinations used in the psychology laboratory are very simple and can be addressed using perceptual processes. However, data from our own research in complex domains that use complex graphs shows extensive use of spatial processing. We propose an extension to current models of graph comprehension in which spatial processing occurs a) when information is not explicitly represented in the graph and b) when simple perceptual processes are inadequate to extract that implicit information. We apply this model extension to some previously published research on graph comprehension from different labs, and find that it is able to account for the results.},

  abstract  = {Graphs are used extensively to facilitate the communication and comprehension of quantitative information, perhaps because they seem to exploit natural properties of our visual system such as the ability to process large amounts of information in parallel. Rather than a holistic pattern recognition process, however, research has found that graph comprehension is a complex, interactive process akin to text comprehension. Viewers form a mental model of the quantitative information displayed in the graph through serial, iterative cycles of identifying and relating the graphic patterns to associated variables. Furthermore, graph comprehension is not only constrained by bottom-up perceptual features of the graphical display, but is also influenced by top-down factors such as the viewer's expectations about, or familiarity with, the graph's content. Finally, individual differences in graph comprehension skill and domain knowledge interact with the bottom-up influences such that highly skilled graph viewers are less influenced by both the bottom-up and top-down visual characteristics.},

The study of diagrammatic reasoning often focuses on computational models of diagram use rather than on studies of human performance. This chapter presents a survey of the empirical and theoretical research that has investigated these processes. It considers the origins, interpretation and manipulation of diagrams, treating diagrams as a notational system that can be used and studied in an experimental context. This is a review of the experimental psychology literature rather than a complete theoretical framework, and is particularly intended as an introduction to the field for those who are commencing research projects into diagrammatic reasoning, having come from a discipline other than cognitive psychology.},

  abstract = {The reports published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are comprehensive assessments of the scientific knowledge and uncertainties surrounding climate projections. They combine well-formed language with supporting graphical evidence and have the objective to inform policymakers. One of the most discussed and widely distributed visual in these reports is the graph, showing the global surface temperature evolution for the 21Ë¢áµ century as simulated by climate models for various emission scenarios, which is part of the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) and the Working Group I contribution to the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). It displays two types of uncertainties, namely the socio-economic scenarios and response uncertainty due to imperfect knowledge and models. Through 43 in-depth interviews this graph and caption was empirically tested with a sample of people analogous to the SPM target audience. It was found that novice readers were unable to identify the two different types of uncertainties in this graph without substantial guidance. Instead they saw a great deal of uncertainty but falsely attributed it to the climate model(s) and ignored the scenario uncertainties. Our findings demonstrate how the choice of display can directly impact a reader's perception of the scientific message. A failure to distinguish between these two types of uncertainties could lead to an overestimate of the response uncertainties, and an underestimation of socio-economic choices. We test this assumption and identify the difficulties non-technical audiences have with this graph and how this could inevitably impede its value as a decision support tool.},

However, students sometimes have difficulty comprehending information depicted in graphs. What makes a graph better or worse at communicating relevant quantitative information? How can students learn to interpret graphs more effectively? This article reviews the cognitive literature on how viewers comprehend graphs and the factors that influence viewers' interpretations. Three major factors are considered: the visual characteristics of a graph (e.g., format, animation, color, use of legend, size, etc.), a viewer's knowledge about graphs, and a viewer's knowledge and expectations about the content of the data in a graph. This article provides a set of guidelines for the presentation of graphs to students and considers the implications of graph comprehension research for the teaching of graphical literacy skills. Finally, this article discusses unresolved questions and directions for future research relevant to data presentation and the teaching of graphical literacy skills.},

We describe an experiment and eye movement study, the results of which show that optimal scan paths assumed in the task analysis approximate the detailed sequences of saccades made by individuals. The research demonstrates the computational inequivalence of two sets of informationally equivalent graphs and illustrates how the computational advantages of a representation outweigh factors such as user unfamiliarity. We describe two models, using the ACT rational perceptual motor (ACT-R/PM) cognitive architecture, that replicate the pattern of observed response latencies and the complex scan paths revealed by the eye movement study. Finally, we outline three guidelines for designers of visual displays: Designers should (a) consider how different quantities are encoded within any chosen representational format, (b) consider the full range of alternative varieties of a given task, and (c) balance the cost of familiarization with the computational advantages of less familiar representations. Actual or potential applications of this research include informing the design and selection of appropriate visual displays and illustrating the practice and utility of task analysis, eye tracking, and cognitive modeling for understanding interactive tasks with external representations.},

But there is no consensus on which, if any, model accurately captures the EU political space. In this article, the authors seekto advance their understanding of the EU political space by bringing evidence to bear on the accuracy of four extant models. Following the methodology used to analyze the national political space of Euro-pean democracies, they assemble and code manifestos of party federations written prior to Euro-pean elections. They then use confirmatory factor analysis to analyze the underlying structure of these party federations'policy positions. They also examine temporal differences in party feder-ation positions over several sets of issues. The results of the study indicate that the EU political space is basically one dimensional and similar to the domestic Left-Right dimension in policy content.},

  abstract = {A common concern regarding the viability of institutional reform of the EU is whether European citizens constitute a political community that facilitates democratic governance. One important aspect of this concern is whether public perceptions are structured so as to ease or impede political discourse across Europe. To investigate this question, the authors examine whether the EU mass public organizes its attitudes toward EU policy issues in systematic and meaningful ways. Specifically, they examine whether EU citizens' attitudes across a broad range of policies decided at the EU level are structured consistently with several prominent models of the EU policy space. Using Eurobarometer data, the authors show that citizens' policy positions on EU issues are systematically organized along a single dimension that is different from domestic Left-Right.},

It has been thoroughly criticized, yet a basic question of its validity has not been addressed. In the current article I argue that for the index to be valid, patterns of association presumed by the logic of the index must be present in the data used to calculate it. I apply canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to test these associations within and between the sets of variables that form the left--right (RILE) index, concluding that for countries which have not experienced a communist past the relationship is present, although substantively weak. More important, however, is that for post-communist countries the required associations in the data are clearly not there. The RILE index is therefore an invalid measure of left--right position for this set of countries.},

By analyzing the 2009 VAST Challenge reviews, we gained a better understanding of what is important to our reviewers, both visualization researchers and professional analysts. We also report on a small user study with professional analysts to determine the important factors that they use in evaluating visual analysis systems. We also looked at guidelines developed by researchers in various domains and synthesized the results from these three efforts into an initial set for use by others in the community. One challenge for future visual analytics systems is to help in the generation of reports. In our user study, we also worked with analysts to understand the criteria they used to evaluate the quality of analytic reports. We propose that this knowledge will be useful as researchers look at systems to automate some of the report generation.1 From these two efforts, we produced some initial guidelines for evaluating visual analytics environments and for the evaluation of analytic reports. It is important to understand that these guidelines are initial drafts and are limited in scope as the visual analytics systems we evaluated were used in specific tasks. We propose these guidelines as a starting point for the Visual Analytics Community.},

So far, the use of this technique for the evaluation of visual analytics and visualization is less prominent. We investigate recent scientific publications from the main visualization and visual analytics conferences and journals, as well as related research fields that include an evaluation by eye tracking. Furthermore, we provide an overview of evaluation goals that can be achieved by eye tracking and state-of-the-art analysis techniques for eye tracking data. Ideally, visual analytics leads to a mixed-initiative cognitive system where the mechanism of distribution is the interaction of the user with the visualization environment. Therefore, we also include a discussion of cognitive approaches and models to include the user in the evaluation process. Based on our review of the current use of eye tracking evaluation in our field and the cognitive theory, we propose directions for future research on evaluation methodology, leading to the grand challenge of developing an evaluation approach to the mixed-initiative cognitive system of visual analytics.},

In doing so, we identify a three-dimensional conceptual space of user tasks in visualization, referred to as the task cube, and the more precise concepts {\textquoteleft}objective{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}action{\textquoteright} for tasks. We illustrate the usage of the task cube{\textquoteright}s dimensions in an objective-driven visualization process, in different scenarios of visualization design and evaluation, and for comparing categorizations of abstract tasks.

However, it is not absolutely factual that all uses of visualization are for gaining a deep understanding, unless the term insight is broadened to encompass all types of thought. Even when insight is the focus of a visualization task, it is rather difficult to know what insight is gained, how much, or how accurate. In this paper, we propose that ``saving time'' in accomplishing a user's task is the most fundamental objective. By giving emphasis to ``saving time'', we can establish a concrete metric, alleviate unnecessary contention caused by different interpretations of insight, and stimulate new research efforts in some aspects of visualization, such as empirical studies, design optimization and theories of visualization.},

  abstract = {Visualizing information in user interfaces to complex, large-scale systems is difficult due to visual fragmentation caused by an enormous amount of inter-related data distributed across multiple views. New display dimensions are required to help the user visually integrate and filter such spatially distributed and heterogeneous information. Motion holds promise in this regard as a perceptually efficient display dimension. It has long been known to have a strong grouping effect, suggesting it has potential for filtering and brushing techniques. However, there is little known about which properties of motion are most effective. This paper reviews the prior literature relating to the use of motion for display and discusses the requirements for how motion can be usefully applied to these problems, especially for visualizations incorporating multiple groups of data objects. Results from previous research by the authors suggested motion type was a strong distinguishing feature. Three types of motions in pairwise combinations were compared: linear, circular and expansion/contraction. Combinations of linear directions were also compared to evaluate how great angular separation needs to be to enforce perceptual distinction. The results showed that motion can effectively group objects that are otherwise dissimilar. Type differentiation is more effective than directional differences (except for 90{$^{\circ}$}). Of the three types studied, circular demands the most attention. Angular separation must be 90{$^{\circ}$} to be equally effective. These results suggest that motion can be usefully applied to both filtering and brushing. They also provide the beginnings of a vocabulary of simple motions that can be applied to information visualization.},

  abstract = {Information visualization (InfoVis), the study of transforming data, information, and knowledge into interactive visual representations, is very important to users because it provides mental models of information. The boom in big data analytics has triggered broad use of InfoVis in a variety of domains, ranging from finance to sports to politics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey and key insights into this fast-rising area. The research on InfoVis is organized into a taxonomy that contains four main categories, namely empirical methodologies, user interactions, visualization frameworks, and applications, which are each described in terms of their major goals, fundamental principles, recent trends, and state-of-the-art approaches. At the conclusion of this survey, we identify existing technical challenges and propose directions for future research.},

  abstract  = {Crowdsourcing offers great potential to overcome the limitations of controlled lab studies. To guide future designs of crowdsourcing-based studies for visualization, we review visualization research that has attempted to leverage crowdsourcing for empirical evaluations of visualizations. We discuss six core aspects for successful employment of crowdsourcing in empirical studies for visualization -- participants, study design, study procedure, data, tasks, and metrics & measures. We then present four case studies, discussing potential mechanisms to overcome common pitfalls. This chapter will help the visualization community understand how to effectively and efficiently take advantage of the exciting potential crowdsourcing has to offer to support empirical visualization research.},

  abstract = {Background. Visual aids tend to help diverse and vulnerable individuals understand risk communications, as long as these individuals have a basic understanding of graphs (i.e., graph literacy). Tests of objective graph literacy (OGL) can effectively identify individuals with limited skills, highlighting vulnerabilities and facilitating custom-tailored risk communication. However, the administration of these tests can be time-consuming and may evoke negative emotional reactions (e.g., anxiety). Objectives. To evaluate a brief and easy-to-use assessment of subjective graph literacy (SGL) (i.e., self-reported ability to process and use graphically presented information) and to estimate the robustness and validity of the SGL scale and compare it with the leading OGL scale in diverse samples from different cultures. Participants. Demographically diverse residents (n = 470) of the United States, young adults (n = 172) and patients (n = 175) from Spain, and surgeons (n = 175) from 48 countries. Design. A focus group and 4 studies for instrument development and initial validation (study 1), reliability and convergent and discriminant validity evaluation (study 2), and predictive validity estimation (studies 3 and 4). Measures. Psychometric properties of the scale. Results. In about 1 minute, the SGL scale provides a reliable, robust, and valid assessment of skills and risk communication preferences and evokes fewer negative emotional reactions than the OGL scale. Conclusions. The SGL scale can be suitable for use in clinical research and may be useful as a communication aid in clinical practice. Theoretical mechanisms involved in SGL, emerging applications, limitations, and open questions are discussed.},
