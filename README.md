# Text by Numbers

This website aims to explain text analysis using R (and then mainly [Quanteda](http://quanteda.io/)).

Right now, the website is basically an alternative version of the book that can be found [here](https://scjbruinsma.github.io/qta-book/). Right now there is absolutely no difference between them, but this will change in the future - at least, that is the plan.
