The ``texttricks`` package is designed to offer additional tools to an often overlooked aspect of text analysis: importing the data. All the files for the package can be found on the Github page of the package: https://github.com/SCJBruinsma/texttricks.

To install the package within `R`, use the ``install_github`` command that is part of the devtools package:

```{r, eval=FALSE, results=FALSE, warning==FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("SCJBruinsma/texttricks")
```
